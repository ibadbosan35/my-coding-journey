# My Coding Learning Journey

**Hi — I'm Ibad Ur Rehman**   
This repository documents my path from zero to confident beginner in coding. I update it weekly with notes, mini-projects, and reflections.

## 📚 What I'm learning
- C++ basics (variables, loops, functions)
- Data Structure basics
- Git & GitHub
- Problem solving with guided practice

---

## 🎯 Goals
1. Complete 30 small exercises.
2. Build 3 simple projects with AI help.
3. Deploy a basic static site on GitHub Pages.

---

## 🗂️ Repo structure
See folders:
- `01-basics/` — notes and tiny examples
- `02-mini-projects/` — small projects with explanations
- `weekly-log/` — short weekly updates

## 📝 Example weekly log (2025-11-01)
- Learned: `for` loops in c++.
- Did: followed a 20-minute tutorial and wrote a hello-world script.
- Next: try small loop exercises and commit results.

## 🚀 How I build things (my workflow)
1. Use ChatGPT to generate starter code or explain concepts.  
2. Copy code into files in this repo.  
3. Write a short README for each mini-project explaining what I learned.  
4. Commit changes with clear messages (examples below).
